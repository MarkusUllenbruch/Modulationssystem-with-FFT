# Modulation-System-with-FFT-Implementation
 Build a modulation/ demodulation system that transforms a signal into its frequency domain and lowpass filters it with the fast convolution with the help of FFT.
 
Own implementations of
1. Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and Inverse Discrete Fourier transform (IDFT)
2. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) iterativ
3. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) recursive
4. convolution time domain
5. Lowpass filter in time domain
6. modulation/ demodulation
7. Fast convolution (convolution with FFT)
8. Overall modulation System, which transforms 2 music signals into a high frequency domain
to send the signal. The music signals are demodulated and listened to to hear the sound quality of the demodulated signal and 
to check if there are error fragments due to the transformation. Effects like Aliasing or overlapping frequency domains are
discussed and can be heard in the demodulated signals.

Jupyter notebook and .py implementations are available.
